# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

0-putchar.c 
1-alphabet.c 
2-print_alphabet_x10.c 
3-islower.c 
4-isalpha.c 
## 5-sign.c 

Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

## 6-abs.c 

Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

Prototype: int _abs(int);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: abs. Run man abs to learn more.

## 7-print_last_digit.c 

Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
Returns the value of the last digit

## 8-24_hours.c 

Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);

## 9-times_table.c 

Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

Prototype: void times_table(void);

## 10-add.c 

Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

Prototype: int add(int, int);

## 11-print_to_98.c 

Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

- Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
- Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
- Numbers should be printed in order
- The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
- The last printed number should be 98
- You are allowed to use the standard library

# #advanced
## 100-times_table.c

Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.

Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything

## 101-natural.c

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
